# Music Player
A Web music player inspired by Spotifyâ€™s UI, built entirely from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While some design elements are visually similar to Spotify for familiarity and aesthetics, all application logic, structure, and features are original and developed by me. The app supports music playback, album browsing, playlists, and responsive design, and is fully deployable on static hosting platforms.

Features:

-Custom music player with play, pause, next, previous, and volume controls
-Album and playlist browsing
-Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
-Modern UI inspired by Spotify, but all code and logic are self-written

Tech Stack:
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)
Static hosting (Vercel, Netlify)
